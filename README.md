# TextAdventuresTime
A relatively simple text adventure game I am working on that is stitched together from multiple tutorials, as well as my own personal changes. I am currently working to change the game from utilizing a single page full of game info into an object oriented project so that editing the game would be simpler. Current biggest challenge is figuring out how to create map with a txt file
 
 demogame: The initial base for the game, it utilizes tuples to implement the game
 
 enemies: Has the initial stats for enemies in game
 
 actions: Contains the actions that the player can take
 
 player: Contains player health and actions
 
 items: Contains items in world, signs, food items, weapons, gold, and notes included
 
 tiles: Stats and attributes for world tiles
 
 world: Parses a txt file that dictates how the world map is laid out
 
 game: Starts the game up
